{/* 

The story is kinda convoluted, yet reading it is a breeze. In my opinion it didn’t beat other OuLIPo writers though. Translating all the vocab must have been a tedious task, yet both English and Czech translation managed it respectfully.


Ideas:
- Honest review
- comparison with Pérec or Calvino
- some citations
- conclusion: Reader-friendly and enjoyable even without knowing any references.
- feels sometimes as an exhibition of diverse contexts and field-specific jargon
- genre of "sci-fi thought experiment" – like Inception or Paprika (or name some anime with dopple gangers)
- any such games?
- how the humor works
- is it possible to feel the emotions (e.g someone dying twice)? maybe not?

- An internship at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (Czech Academy of Sciences) where I learned CAD and designed my own prototype of an autonomous space vehicle with constraints on its size and weight, coming up with a novel mechanical design of expandable wheels.
- The design was 3D printed an assembled with motors and electronics to create a fully functional prototype.
- My project won 1st place on a scientific conference in the category of Natural Sciences.

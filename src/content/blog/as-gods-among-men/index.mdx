>So much seems to have changed from the Middle Ages, when the rich were required not to appear to be wealthy (or at least not to show the full extent of their wealth), as the excessive accumulation of material resources was considered intrinsically sinful and even damaging to the correct functioning of a perfect (Christian) society and of its institutions, especially the political ones. As argued by some medieval commentators, if given apparently ‘equal’ access to political institutions, the super-rich would have de facto acted ‘as gods among men’, which was obviously not desirable.  
> And yet, how much has really changed?”

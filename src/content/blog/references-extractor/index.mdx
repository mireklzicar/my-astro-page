Academic research often involves navigating through a labyrinth of references and citations. While exploring papers, I found myself spending more time copying references than engaging with the actual ideas. This repetitive task was stealing valuable time that could be better spent on critical thinking and analysis.

I built **DOI Reference Extractor** — an **open-source** tool that instantly pulls every reference from an academic paper using just its DOI, converts them to over 5000 different citation formats, and enables bulk downloads as individual files or ZIP archives.

## Live Demo

Try the reference extractor below or visit [references.mireklzicar.com](https://references.mireklzicar.com/):

```html
<div style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; overflow: hidden; margin: 20px 0;">
  <iframe
    src="https://references.mireklzicar.com/"
    width="100%"

    title="DOI Reference Extractor"
    style="border: none;"
  />
</div>
```

- **Copy to Clipboard** - Quick copying for immediate use
- **Share Links** - URL sharing with pre-filled DOIs

## How It Works

### Technical Architecture

The DOI Reference Extractor leverages a sophisticated three-step process using multiple academic APIs:

#### 1. Reference Discovery
```typescript
// Step 1: Extract all referenced DOIs from a paper
const response = await fetch(`https://opencitations.net/index/api/v2/references/${doi}`);
const references = await response.json();
```

The application queries the **OpenCitations API v2** to retrieve all references cited by the input paper. OpenCitations maintains a comprehensive database of scholarly citations, making it the perfect starting point for reference extraction.

#### 2. Metadata Retrieval
```typescript
// Step 2: Fetch detailed metadata for each reference
const metadataResponse = await fetch(`https://doi.org/${referenceDoi}`, {
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json' // or other format
  }
});
```

For each discovered reference DOI, the tool uses **DOI Content Negotiation** provided by Crossref to fetch comprehensive metadata including:
- Paper titles and abstracts
- Author names and affiliations
- Publication dates and venues
- Publisher information
- Citation counts and metrics

#### 3. Format Conversion
```typescript
// Step 3: Convert to desired citation format
const citationResponse = await fetch(`https://doi.org/${referenceDoi}`, {
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'text/x-bibliography; style=apa' // or other CSL style
  }
});
```

The final step leverages DOI Content Negotiation's support for **Citation Style Language (CSL)** to convert each reference into the user's chosen format or style.

### API Integration Details

The application integrates with three key services:

1. **[OpenCitations API](https://opencitations.net/index/api/v2)**
   - Provides comprehensive citation indexing
   - Returns DOIs of all papers referenced by the input DOI
   - Offers citation metadata and relationship mapping

2. **[DOI Content Negotiation](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/content-negotiation/)**
   - Crossref's API for metadata retrieval and format conversion
   - Supports multiple output formats (BibTeX, RIS, CSL JSON, etc.)
   - Implements Citation Style Language for text formatting

3. **Citation Style Language (CSL)**
   - Community-maintained repository of 5000+ citation styles
   - Standardized formatting for academic citations
   - Support for journal-specific requirements

## Tech Stack & Implementation

The application is built with modern web technologies for optimal performance and user experience:

```json
{
  "framework": "React 19 with TypeScript",
  "build_tool": "Vite",
  "styling": "Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI",
  "api_client": "Axios",
  "file_processing": "JSZip",
  "routing": "React Router",
  "deployment": "Docker + Vercel"
}
```

### Key Technical Features

- **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of invalid DOIs and API failures
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time progress indicators for large reference sets
- **Batch Processing** - Efficient handling of papers with hundreds of references
- **Caching Strategy** - Optimized API calls to reduce redundant requests

### Docker Deployment

The application includes production-ready Docker configuration:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

This enables easy deployment across different environments and cloud providers.

## Why I Built This & Open Source Philosophy

During a recent literature review, I realized I was spending more time on the mechanical task of copying citations than on analyzing and connecting ideas. What started as a simple evening project to solve my own problem quickly became a tool others found useful too.

**I believe academic tools should be open and accessible to everyone.** That's why DOI Reference Extractor is completely **open-source** under the Apache 2.0 license. The entire codebase, including documentation and deployment scripts, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mireklzicar/doi-reference-extractor).

### Benefits for Researchers

The DOI Reference Extractor eliminates this busywork, allowing researchers to:
- **Save time** by instantly capturing all references from any paper
- **Follow citation trails** efficiently across research domains
- **Standardize references** using consistent formatting
- **Focus on ideas** rather than mechanical citation work
- **Collaborate easily** by sharing formatted reference lists
- **Support reproducibility** through consistent citation practices

### Open Source Advantages

By making this tool open-source, the research community benefits from:
- **Transparency** - Full visibility into how references are processed
- **Customization** - Ability to modify for specific institutional needs
- **Community contributions** - Improvements and bug fixes from users worldwide
- **No vendor lock-in** - Complete control and self-hosting options
- **Academic freedom** - No restrictions or usage limits

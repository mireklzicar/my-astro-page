Academic research often involves navigating through a labyrinth of references and citations. While exploring papers, I found myself spending more time copying references than engaging with the actual ideas. This repetitive task was stealing valuable time that could be better spent on critical thinking and analysis.

I built **DOI Reference Extractor** — a simple yet powerful tool that instantly pulls every reference from an academic paper using just its DOI, allowing you to export citations in multiple formats with a single click.

## Live Demo

Try the reference extractor below or visit [references.mireklzicar.com](https://references.mireklzicar.com/):

## How It Works

### Simple 2-Step Process

1. **Enter a DOI** - Just paste any valid Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and press Enter
2. **Get All References** - The tool instantly retrieves every reference cited in the paper

### Multiple Export Formats

Export the references in your format of choice:
- **BibTeX** for LaTeX users
- **RIS** for EndNote, Mendeley, and other reference managers
- **APA**, **ACS**, **MLA** formats for direct citation in papers
- And more common citation styles

## Why I Built This

During a recent literature review, I realized I was spending more time on the mechanical task of copying citations than on analyzing and connecting ideas. What started as a simple evening project to solve my own problem quickly became a tool others found useful too.

The DOI Reference Extractor eliminates this busywork, allowing researchers to:
- **Save time** by instantly capturing all references
- **Follow citation trails** efficiently
- **Standardize references** across papers
- **Focus on ideas** rather than formatting

## Example Outputs

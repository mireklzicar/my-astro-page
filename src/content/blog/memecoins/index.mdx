title: "Memecoins as a Vanity Fair: only 1 in 10 000 Solana tokens has a social footprint and clears a basic rug‑check"
summary: "Using on‑chain metadata for every token minted on Solana in February 2025, we show that fewer than 0.01 % of fresh meme‑coins meet even the loosest criteria for legitimacy."

This note tries to put numbers on a few simple questions:

* **How many tokens are minted in a single month?**
* **What share shows any sign of contact, social site or online community – a website, an email, Telagram, GitHub, X handle, Discord?**
* **How many survive a first‑pass “rug‑check” (liquidity, ownership dispersion, locked LP)?**

The exercise is deliberately narrow – Solana only, one calendar month only – and deliberately modest: I do **not** tell you which coin to ape into next.
Instead, I try to quantify just how *lottery‑like* the memecoin field has become.

## Methodology

### Data collection

* **Token universe** – I pulled every mint event with Dextools API<Cite id="dextools" /> between 2025‑02‑01 00:00 UTC and 2025‑02‑29 23:59 UTC (≈ 756 648 unique mint addresses).
* **Social footprint** – For each address I queried `/socialInfo`. A token counts as *having socials* if **any** of the 16 supported fields (website, email, X/Twitter, Telegram, GitHub, …) is non‑empty.
* **Rug‑check** – I fed the mint address to rugcheck.xyz<Cite id="rugcheck" /> and labelled the coin *"passes"* when no alert of level `warn` or `danger` was returned.

### Limitations & Reproducibility

* No attempt was made to evaluate *utility*, *road‑map*, or *fair launch* claims – the scope is purely **red‑flag hygiene**. I haven't evaluated more sophisticated schemes such as *bundling*.
* A single month of February‑2025 is analyzed to decrease API costs. It is not necessarily representative.
* The analysis ignores **copy‑minting on other chains** (Blast, Base).
* Rug‑check's heuristics update over time; re‑running the script next year will shift numbers.
* The full python scripts and query notebooks (Python, Jupyter) and raw JSON and CSV files live in a GitHub repo I can share upon request<Cite id="bitquery" />.

## Results

### Aggregate counts

<Table
  headers={["Metric", "Tokens", "Share"]}
  rows={[
    ["Total coins", "756 648", "100 %"],
    ["With ≥ 1 social link", "742", "0.10 %"],
    ["Pass all rug‑check tests", "91", "0.012 %"],
  ]}
  striped={true}
  bordered={true}
  hover={true}
/>

Put differently, **only one in \~10 000 freshly minted Solana tokens both tells you who they are *and* shows no obvious technical red flags**.

### Which socials matter?

<Table
  headers={["Platform", "Count", "Percentage"]}
  rows={[
    ["x/twitter", "685", "92.3%"],
    ["telegram", "678", "91.4%"],
    ["website", "547", "73.7%"],
    ["email", "198", "26.7%"],
    ["reddit", "23", "3.1%"],
    ["instagram", "18", "2.4%"],
    ["tiktok", "17", "2.3%"],
    ["github", "15", "2.0%"],
    ["discord", "12", "1.6%"],
    ["youtube", "7", "0.9%"],
    ["facebook", "5", "0.7%"],
    ["medium", "3", "0.4%"],
  ]}
  striped={true}
  bordered={true}
  hover={true}
/>

### Rug‑check alert stack

<Table
  headers={["Alert", "Count", "Percentage"]}
  rows={[
    ["Low amount of LP Providers", "572", "29.5%"],
    ["Low Liquidity", "349", "18.0%"],
    ["Single holder ownership", "238", "12.3%"],
    ["Top 10 holders high ownership", "179", "9.2%"],
    ["High ownership", "159", "8.2%"],
    ["Mutable metadata", "145", "7.5%"],
    ["Large Amount of LP Unlocked", "121", "6.2%"],
    ["Creator history of rugged tokens", "89", "4.6%"],
    ["High holder concentration", "24", "1.2%"],
    ["Fee config enabled", "16", "0.8%"],
    ["High holder correlation", "15", "0.8%"],
    ["Copycat token", "13", "0.7%"],
    ["Symbol Mismatch", "5", "0.3%"],
    ["Name Mismatch", "4", "0.2%"],
    ["Mint Authority still enabled", "4", "0.2%"],
    ["Low Amount of holders", "3", "0.2%"],
    ["Freeze Authority still enabled", "1", "0.1%"],

## Discussion

### 1. Socials ≠ legitimacy, but absence is a screaming red flag

A Telegram channel costs nothing; a GitHub repo can be copied in seconds.
Yet 99.9 % of tokens **don’t bother**.
That aligns with anecdotal trading heuristics – *"If it has no X handle, skip"*<Cite id="redditStrategy" /> – shared by veteran Solana snipers.

### 2. Rug‑checks as hygiene, not due diligence

Tools such as Rugcheck, Sniperoo or DEXTools' "honey‑pot" detector<Cite id="dextoolsGlossary" /> catch the *low‑hanging scams* – unlocked LP, mint authority, fee‑on‑transfer.

They do **not** protect against:

* **Bundlers / soft rugs** – devs sell liquidity gradually after building trust<Cite id="merkle" />.
* **VC unlock cliffs** disguised as "community airdrops"<Cite id="chainplay" />.
* **Social engineering** via celebrity hacks (the \$PSYOP saga on X)<Cite id="nypost" />.

### 3. Why so many mints?

The *zero‑to‑token* cost on pump.fun fell from 6 SOL to **0.1 SOL** in January 2025<Cite id="pumpfun" />, pushing the daily mint count above **280 k** at peak.
When the marginal cost of creation is \~\$10 and upside is a BONK‑like 1000×, *spam* is rational<Cite id="fortune" />.

### 4. Half‑life and the greater‑fool problem

If a coin’s viable window is measured in *hours*, timing eclipses fundamentals.
Trading becomes a reflex game – hence the proliferation of sniper bots, bundle sniffers and real‑time Rugcheck APIs.

There is a handful of more-or-less mainstream quality magazines, curated journals or media I enjoy, to name a few: [Aeon](https://aeon.co/), which is focused more on essays and culture and [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/), a magazine with math and scientific topics conveyed in a format readable to everyone. However, the hidden gems are to be found in personal blogs, dev blogs or tech blogs, substacks and github pages. The following list captures some of my favourites. Maybe you already know most of them, maybe not.

## Introduction

This is a demonstration of how to use the new References component to place citations where you want them in your MDX files, rather than having them automatically appended as footnotes.

## Using Citations

You can cite sources using the Cite component like this <Cite id="first-citation" /> and this <Cite id="second-citation" />. The citations will appear where you place the References component.

## Custom Placement

The key difference is that you can now control where your references appear by placing the `<References>` component in your MDX file.

```jsx
<References title="References">
  <Citation id="first-citation">
    This is the first citation.
  </Citation>
  <Citation id="second-citation">
    This is the second citation.
  </Citation>
</References>
```

You can also customize the title or omit it:

```jsx
<References title="Sources">
  <Citation id="example1">
    Citation content here
  </Citation>
</References>

<!-- Or without a title -->
<References>
  <Citation id="example2">
    Another citation here
  </Citation>
</References>
```

<References title="References">
  <Citation id="first-citation">
    This is the first citation. It can include links, *formatting*, and other Markdown elements.
  </Citation>
  
  <Citation id="second-citation">
    Smith, J. (2025). *How to Use References in MDX*. Example Publishing.
  </Citation>
</References>

## Content After References

You can continue writing content after the references section. The footnotes will only appear where you placed the References component, not at the end of the document.

## How It Works

The References component:

1. Provides a container for your reference definitions
2. Hides the automatically generated footnotes section
3. Ensures proper styling and numbering of references
4. Optionally adds a heading with the title you specify

The component handles:

- Proper numbering of references (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Styling references with proper indentation
- Hiding the automatically generated footnotes section
- Formatting the citation numbers in the text as superscript

This gives you complete control over where your citations appear in your document while maintaining a consistent style.

## Additional Features

You can customize the References component with these props:

- `title`: The heading text (defaults to "References" if not provided)
- `className`: Additional CSS classes to apply to the container

For example:

```mdx
<References title="Bibliography" className="my-custom-class">
  <Citation id="example3">
    Example citation with custom class
  </Citation>
</References>
```
